# Library-Management-System
**Project Overview**

The Library Management System is a C++ console-based application designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It allows libraries to manage book catalogs, issue books to students, and maintain records efficiently.

This system demonstrates classes, objects, encapsulation, and file handling in a real-world scenario.

**Features**

Secure Login: Only authorized users (admin) can access the system.

Add New Books: Add books to the library catalog with ID and Title.

Issue Books: Issue books to students and save the issue record.

**View Records:**

View the full book catalog.

View issued books history.

File Handling: All records are stored in text files (library.txt and issued.txt) for persistent storage.

**Technologies Used**

Programming Language: C++

File Handling: To store catalog and issued books.

**OOP Concepts:**
Classes & Objects: Author and Library classes.

Encapsulation: Data and methods are organized inside classes.

IDE: Code::Blocks / Dev C++ / Any C++ compiler
